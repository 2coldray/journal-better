# Journal Better

## Description

Journal Better is a journaling app that allows the user to keep track of their specific goals for any day. They are given access to all seven days for that week, where they can organize how they will be spending their time, and edit whenever. At the end of the week, the user can reflect on how their week went, and if all goals were achieved, or if not, what can be done to do better going forward. Every jornal entry has an accurate date, for precise keeping, which can make looking back simple. Essentially, the user will get out what they put in, and every experience will differ.

Today's Summary page is where the user can make notes about what they intend to do that day on the left. At the end of the day, they make notes on whether or not they did what they said they were going to and compare.

Once the user has compared the two and has their thoughts organized, it is time to journal. The journal can be saved by clicking on the Save Entry button at the bottom of the text area.
